## How does it work?

Follow the instructions to solve the puzzle:

- Upon getting to the repository the user sees various commits and issues
- The 'about' page contains instructions to fork the repo as well as a list of numbers and letters that upon closer inspection are related to different pairs of commits.
- The user must then track down the different commits and look for the differences between them (a mix of binary and hex strings)
- Once finding all of the differences, the user must convert all of them into ASCII to reveal the github issue they need to find. 
- The github issue contains a list of instructions for the user to follow github commands to pull certain branches/commits together. 
- Upon merging these commits the answer is revealed by running the code
