## How does it work?

Follow the instructions to solve the puzzle:

1) Upon getting to the repository the user sees various commits and issues
2) Track down the following different commits and look in the comments sections to find the right commit. In every comment section will be a different letter which reveals the final commit for the upcoming steps:

- 7a6cf85b23721588dfd6bed3cef85e8f7922700c
- a62551678e3c015cc0a619ea5810c13d2197a4c7
- 6ae987d64fd3dbc29c17eb29f4db186d6b617223
- 962cb7f68373c36402345fbb3397683f6f8243fe

- 19ac339018a9b8f98dcb1d7559a184567c61069b

3) Take the differences in the files and convert all of them into ASCII to reveal the final commit you need to look for. To receive it, use the ASCII code and paste it into the chatbot which gives you the answer: https://assistant-chat-us-south.watsonplatform.net/web/public/e8478f24-171b-4038-a441-bf1cf5873b4c
4) The github issue contains a list of instructions to follow github commands.
5) Find the right timestamp and put it into the chatbot to receive the final answer.
